# Waveger Billboard API

A REST API service that powers the Waveger frontend with Billboard music charts data, featuring built-in Redis caching for improved performance and Apple Music integration.

## üåê Live API

The API is deployed and accessible at:

```
https://waveger-api.onrender.com
```

Example API call:

```
https://waveger-api.onrender.com/billboard_api.php?id=hot-100
```

## üìã Overview

This service works as the backend API for the Waveger music application, providing seamless access to Billboard charts data via RapidAPI. It implements Redis caching to improve performance and reduce API calls for frequently accessed chart data. Additionally, it enriches the chart data with Apple Music information, including song previews and high-quality artwork.

- Historical data access by specifying a week parameter
- Apple Music integration:
  - Song previews and high-resolution artwork
  - Direct links to Apple Music
  - Efficient parallel processing of music data
  - Automatic JWT token management
- Smart caching strategy:
  - Current charts checked for updates every Tuesday
  - Hourly rechecking on Tuesdays until new data appears
  - Fallback to cached data during API outages
  - Current charts cached for 1 week
  - Historical charts cached permanently
  - Apple Music search results cached for 24 hours
- Option to force-refresh data anytime
- Robust error handling:
  - Smart detection and management of API rate limits
  - Automatic fallback to cached data during API downtime
  - Clear informative error messages
  - 10-second timeout prevention for hanging requests

## üéµ Apple Music Integration

The API integrates with Apple Music to provide additional data for songs in the chart:

### Features

- **Song Previews**: 30-second high-quality audio previews for each song
- **High-Resolution Artwork**: Full-sized album artwork (1000x1000)
- **Direct Links**: Official Apple Music song URLs
- **Efficient Processing**: Uses parallel processing to minimize response time
- **Smart Caching**: Apple Music data is cached separately to prevent redundant API calls

### Implementation Details

- **Authentication**: Uses JWT authentication with Apple-issued credentials
- **Token Management**: Automatically handles token generation and renewal (12-hour validity)
- **Parallel Processing**: Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to process multiple songs simultaneously
- **Search Optimization**: Uses both song title and artist name for accurate matching
- **Separate Caching**: Apple Music search results are cached for 24 hours to reduce API load

## üìä Available Charts

The API supports the following Billboard charts:

Additional charts may be available through the API. The `id` parameter in your API request should match the chart ID from this list.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the API:

1. **API Unavailable**: The service will automatically fall back to cached data if the Billboard API is experiencing downtime. Look for the `note` field in the response for details.

2. **Rate Limiting**: If you receive responses with a note about rate limiting, this means the upstream Billboard API has temporarily limited our requests. The system will automatically:

   - Serve cached data during the rate-limited period
   - Implement a 5-minute cooldown before trying the API again
   - Resume normal operations once the rate limit period expires

3. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Billboard occasionally updates their chart structure, which may affect response formats.

4. **Missing Apple Music Data**: Not all songs may have matches in Apple Music. The API will still return Billboard data even if Apple Music data is missing.

5. **Error Response Codes**:
   - `503`: Service Unavailable - Indicates the Billboard API is unavailable or rate limited
   - `500`: Internal Server Error - Unexpected errors in processing
   - `504`: Gateway Timeout - Request to Billboard API timed out

For any persistent issues, please report them to the API maintainer.
