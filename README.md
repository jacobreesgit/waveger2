# Waveger Billboard API

A REST API service that powers the Waveger frontend with Billboard music charts data, featuring built-in Redis caching for improved performance.

## üåê Live API

The API is deployed and accessible at:

```
https://waveger-api.onrender.com
```

Example API call:

```
https://waveger-api.onrender.com/billboard_api.php?id=hot-100
```

## üìã Overview

This service works as the backend API for the Waveger music application, providing seamless access to Billboard charts data via RapidAPI. It implements Redis caching to improve performance and reduce API calls for frequently accessed chart data.

## ‚ú® Features

- Access to Billboard music charts data (Hot-100, Billboard 200, etc.)
- Historical data access by specifying a week parameter
- Smart caching strategy:
  - Current charts checked for updates every Tuesday
  - Hourly rechecking on Tuesdays until new data appears
  - Fallback to cached data during API outages
  - Current charts cached for 1 week
  - Historical charts cached permanently
- Option to force-refresh data anytime
- Robust error handling:
  - Smart detection and management of API rate limits
  - Automatic fallback to cached data during API downtime
  - Clear informative error messages
  - 10-second timeout prevention for hanging requests

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python) with application factory pattern
- **Caching**: Redis via Flask-Caching
- **Data Source**: Billboard Charts API on RapidAPI
- **Deployment**: Render
- **Testing**: Pytest with freezegun for time-dependent tests

## üß™ Testing

The API includes a comprehensive test suite built with pytest. The tests cover:

- API response handling for different chart types
- Caching behavior for both current and historical charts
- Tuesday refresh logic for chart updates
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Rate limiting detection and management

To run the tests:

```cd /backend
python -m pytest
```

The test suite uses:

- **pytest**: For test framework and assertions
- **unittest.mock**: For mocking external API requests
- **freezegun**: For testing time-dependent logic like Tuesday updates

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the API:

1. **API Unavailable**: The service will automatically fall back to cached data if the Billboard API is experiencing downtime. Look for the `note` field in the response for details.

2. **Rate Limiting**: If you receive responses with a note about rate limiting, this means the upstream Billboard API has temporarily limited our requests. The system will automatically:

   - Serve cached data during the rate-limited period
   - Implement a 5-minute cooldown before trying the API again
   - Resume normal operations once the rate limit period expires

3. **Missing or Incomplete Data**: Billboard occasionally updates their chart structure, which may affect response formats.

4. **Error Response Codes**:
   - `503`: Service Unavailable - Indicates the Billboard API is unavailable or rate limited
   - `500`: Internal Server Error - Unexpected errors in processing
   - `504`: Gateway Timeout - Request to Billboard API timed out

For any persistent issues, please report them to the API maintainer.
